# ISETBioCSF

[![Build Status](http://brainard-jenkins.psych.upenn.edu/buildStatus/icon?job=ISETBioCSF)](http://brainard-jenkins.psych.upenn.edu/job/ISETBioCSF/)

An isetbio computational observer for detection thresholds of contrast gratings. The goal of these calculations is to understand how various factors early in the visual pathways limit performance on this simple and rigorously characterized visual task.

This repository was formerly named IBIOColorDetect, and there are still remnants of that naming in various places.

Documentation for this project is available at the wiki: https://github.com/isetbio/IBIOColorDetect/wiki.
