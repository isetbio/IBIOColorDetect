% There is a serial dependence between tutorials for data:
% t_plotDetectThresholds depends on data from t_fitPsychometricFunctions,
% which depends on data from t_colorDetectFindPerformance, which depends on
% data from t_coneCurrentEyeMovementsResponseInstances.
% 
% The problem with these tutorials was that the default value for
% freezeNoize in t_coneCurrentEyeMovementsResponseInstances was set to
% false, whereas  the t_colorDetectFindPerformance had this set to true. So
% t_colorDetectFindPerformance was crashing because it could find the data
% it was looking for and similarly for the other dependent tutorials.
% 
% My theory is that the tutorials used to work in the past because at some
% point t_coneCurrentEyeMovementsResponseInstances was run with that flag
% set to false and the data that the other tutorials were looking for
% existed on the disk. But now, for some reason the data files with the
% freezeNoize flag set to false do not exist.
% 
% I fixed all this by setting the default value of freezeNoise in
% t_coneCurrentEyeMovementsResponseInstances to true. This is how we set
% this flag when we call  t_coneCurrentEyeMovementsResponseInstances from
% all the CSF simulations by the way.
% 
% You may have to run t_coneCurrentEyeMovementsResponseInstances by itself
% to generate the data and then run all the other tutorials.
